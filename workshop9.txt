1. Whats the difference between Django, Flask, and Ruby on Rails?
Django helps keep code simple and non-repeating, but it has a steep learning curve, 
whereas Flask is much easier to pickup and is a lightweight framework. Ruby on Rails is
different from Django and Flask because it follows a MVC architecture, but it is similar 
to Flask in that it is beginner-friendly.
2. When might you use each of those frameworks?
If your app does not require a SQL database, then you can use Flask. Flask can also be 
used for smaller and less complicated apps. Whereas Django can be used for bigger apps.
Ruby on Rails can be used when your app is not super complicated.
